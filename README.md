# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Description

The "Customer Churn Analysis" project examines customer churn rates in three regions (France, Germany, and Spain) over a four-year period (2016-2019).
The dataset includes KPIs such as total customers, active customers, inactive customers, credit card holders, non-credit card holders, exit customers, and retained customers.

The project aims to identify churn patterns and provide insights for improving customer retention strategies. 

The interactive Power BI dashboard enables users to explore the data and make data-driven decisions to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.

## How to Install and Run the Project

1.	Install the latest version of Power BI Desktop
2.	Download the project files from repository
3.	Open Power BI Desktop and load the project file

## How to Use the Project
Use the year and month filters to select a specific timeframe for analysis.

Utilize the geography filter to focus on a specific region (France, Germany, or Spain).

Apply the active category filter to analyze churn behavior for "Active" or "Inactive" customers.

Use the exit category filter to investigate churn patterns for customers who "Exit" or "Retain."

Explore churn dynamics based on gender using the gender category filter.

## Key Achievements of the project

Highest Exit and Retain Year: The year 2019 had the highest number of exit and retain customers,
indicating important trends or factors influencing customer behavior during that period.

Lowest Exit and Retain Year: The year 2016 had the lowest number of exit and retain customers, showcasing successful retention strategies during that specific year.

Exit Type Analysis: "Fair" credit score range (580-669) had the highest number of exits, while the "Excellent" credit score range (800-850) had the lowest number of exits. 
This suggests a possible correlation between credit scores and customer churn, with customers in the "Fair" range being more likely to exit.

## Data Sources of the project

The project utilizes data from various sources:

1: MySQL : The main dataset which is Bank_Churn Data comes from a MySQL database and contains comprehensive information about customer churn, 
including demographics, activity level, exit type, and credit scores.

2: CSV/Excel Files: Supplementary data in CSV or Excel format is also incorporated, providing additional details such as customer transactions, geographical data
and market trends.
